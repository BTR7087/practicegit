You enter a dungeon with your trusty sword and shield.
You are searching for the evil necromancer who killed your family. 
You've heard that he resides at the bottom of the dungeon, guarded by legions of the undead.
You enter the first door and see special locks. Bugs are frantically rolling on the door. 
You try to jump from the ledge by using a worm-like person, but they eat your dear sword and shield. Your archer twice jump up 
while stealing your shield and sliced your shield.
